# ITU GAM-503E Project

This project was developed within a limited timeframe as part of the GAM-503E course at ITU. Despite the time constraints, it includes some interesting systems that you might want to explore:

- 🧱 **Procedural Dungeon Generation** using Cellular Automata  
- 💬 **Dialogue System** with branching options  
- ⚔️ **Tile Selection Mechanics** based on equipped weapons

Feel free to check out the code and experiment with the systems!
